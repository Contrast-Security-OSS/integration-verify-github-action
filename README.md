# ContrastAssessVerifyAction

This action verifies an Assess application, applying a Job Outcome Policy or vulnerability threshold to fail the step if there are open vulnerabilities violating the policy/threshold.

## Inputs

## `apiKey`

**Required** Contrast User/Service Account API Key.

## `orgId`

**Required** Contrast Organization ID.

## `apiUrl`

URL of your Contrast Teamserver Instance (should begin with `https://` or `http://`).
Defaults to `https://app.contrastsecurity.com`
(`/Contrast/api/ng/` is used automatically if omitted)

## `serviceKey`

Contrast User/Service Account service key. Required if authorization not passed.

## `authHeader`

Contrast User/Service Account Authorization Header. **Required** if username and service key not passed.

## `userName`

Contrast User/Service Account username. Required if authorization not passed.

## `appId`

ID of the application to verify against. **Required** if app_name not passed.

## `appName`

Name of the application to verify against. **Required** if app_id not passed.

## `buildNumber`

The build number or app version tag to filter vulnerabilities by.

## `failThreshold`

Number of vulnerabilities that are needed to fail the build (not used if there is a defined job outcome policy).
Defaults to `0`

## `jobStartTime`

Filter vulnerabilities first found after this timestamp (formatted **in milliseconds** since the epoch). Defaults to `0`

## `severities`

Comma separated list of vulnerability severities to consider (not used if there is a defined job outcome policy).
Defaults to `CRITICAL,HIGH`


## Example usage

```yaml
uses: andersonshatch/ContrastAssessVerifyAction@main
with:
  apiKey: ${{ secrets.CONTRAST_API_KEY }}
  orgId: ${{ env.CONTRAST_ORG_ID }}
  apiUrl: app.contrastsecurity.com
  authHeader: ${{ secrets.CONTRAST_AUTH_HEADER }}
  appName: App_Name_Here
  #appId: app_uuid_here
```

### Job Start Time

The job start time value can be generated with the following step, running prior to your tests:
```yaml
jobs:
  ...:
    steps:
      - name: Define job start time
        run: |
          import time
          n = int(round(time.time() * 1000))
          print(f"::set-output name=jobStartTime::{n}")
        shell: python
        id: set-job-start-time
```
And then used in the verify action with:

`jobStartTime: "${{ steps.set-job-start-time.outputs.jobStartTime }}"`

This approach is useful when you want to consider only new vulnerabilities found by this action run, for example in a pull request.

## Development Setup
1. Run `python -m venv venv` to setup a virtual environment
1. Run `. venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment
1. Run `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` to install development dependencies (will also include app dependencies)
1. Run `pre-commit install` to setup the pre-commit hook which handles formatting
